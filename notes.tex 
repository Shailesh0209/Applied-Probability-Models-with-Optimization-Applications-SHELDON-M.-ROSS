# **Applied Probability Models with Optimization Applications â€“ Notes**
### **By Sheldon M. Ross (Chapters 1-5)**  

---

## **1. INTRODUCTION TO STOCHASTIC PROCESSES**  
### **1.1 Random Variables and Probability Theory**
- **Random Variable (RV):** A function mapping outcomes of a random experiment to real numbers.
- **Types of RVs:**  
  - **Discrete:** Countable values (e.g., Binomial, Poisson).  
  - **Continuous:** Uncountable values (e.g., Normal, Exponential).  
- **Probability Distributions:**  
  - Probability Mass Function (PMF) for discrete RVs.  
  - Probability Density Function (PDF) for continuous RVs.  
  - Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): \(F(x) = P(X \leq x)\).  
- **Expectation & Variance:**  
  - \(E[X] = \sum x P(X=x)\) (discrete), \(\int x f(x)dx\) (continuous).  
  - **Variance:** \(Var(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2\).  
  - **Moments:** \(E[X^n]\) gives higher-order characteristics.  

### **1.2 Conditional Expectation**
- **Conditional Probability:** \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \).  
- **Conditional Expectation:**  
  - \(E[X|Y=y]\) represents the expected value of \(X\) given \(Y=y\).  
  - **Law of Total Expectation:** \(E[X] = E[E[X|Y]]\).  
- **Applications in Decision Making:** Used in **Bayesian inference** and **dynamic programming**.

### **1.3 Stochastic Processes**
- **Definition:** A collection of random variables \(\{X_t\}\) indexed over time \(t\).  
- **Types of Stochastic Processes:**  
  - **Discrete-time vs Continuous-time.**  
  - **Markov Process:** Future states depend only on the present state, not past history.  
  - **Poisson Process:** Counts the number of events in a fixed time interval.  
  - **Renewal Process:** Describes successive arrivals over time.

## **2. THE POISSON PROCESS**  
### **2.1 Introduction and Definitions**
- **Poisson Process:** A stochastic process representing the number of events occurring in a time interval.  
- **Key Properties:**  
  - **Independent increments:** Non-overlapping intervals are independent.  
  - **Stationary increments:** Number of arrivals depends only on interval length, not start time.  
  - **Interarrival times are Exponentially distributed:** \(P(T > t) = e^{-\lambda t}\), where \(\lambda\) is the arrival rate.

### **2.2 Interarrival and Waiting Time Distributions**
- **Interarrival Time:** Time between two consecutive events follows \(Exp(\lambda)\).  
- **Waiting Time (Nth Arrival):** Follows Gamma distribution:  
  \[
  P(T_n \leq t) = 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(\lambda t)^k e^{-\lambda t}}{k!}
  \]  

### **2.3 Conditional Distribution of Arrival Times**
- **Given \(N(t) = k\), the event times** are distributed uniformly in \( (0, t) \).  
- **Used in simulations and statistical inference.**  

### **2.4 Compound and Nonhomogeneous Poisson Processes**
- **Compound Poisson Process:** Event magnitudes are random variables.  
- **Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process:** Rate \(\lambda(t)\) varies over time.  

### **2.5 Stationary Point Processes**
- **Generalized Poisson Processes where interarrival times are identically distributed but not necessarily exponential.**

## **3. RENEWAL THEORY**  
### **3.1 Introduction and Preliminaries**
- **Renewal process models repeated independent events (e.g., machine repairs).**  
- **Key Random Variables:**  
  - **Interarrival times \(X_i\).**  
  - **Number of renewals \(N(t)\).**  

### **3.2 Renewal Equation and Generalizations**
- **Basic Renewal Equation:**  
  \[
  m(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} F_n(t)
  \]  
  where \(F_n(t)\) is the nth convolution of \(F(t)\).  

### **3.3 Limit Theorems**
- **Key Result: Renewal Theorem**  
  \[
  \frac{N(t)}{t} \to \frac{1}{E[X]} \quad \text{as } t \to \infty.
  \]  

### **3.4 Waldâ€™s Equation**
- If \(S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\), then  
  \[
  E[S_N] = E[N]E[X].
  \]  

### **3.5-3.11 Further Concepts**
- **Excess Life and Age Distribution.**  
- **Delayed Renewal Processes.**  
- **Renewal Reward Process:** Reward per renewal cycle.  
- **Branching Processes:** Population growth models.

## **4. MARKOV CHAINS**  
### **4.1 Preliminaries and Examples**
- **Markov Chain Definition:**  
  \[
  P(X_{n+1} | X_n, X_{n-1}, \dots, X_0) = P(X_{n+1} | X_n).
  \]  
- **Transition Probability Matrix \(P\):** Represents state transition probabilities.  

### **4.2 Classification of States**
- **Communicating States:** Can reach each other in finite steps.  
- **Transient vs Recurrent:** Recurrent states are visited infinitely often.  

### **4.3 Limit Theorems**
- **Stationary Distribution \( \pi \):**  
  \[
  \pi P = \pi.
  \]  
  where \(\pi\) is the limiting probability vector.  

### **4.4-4.6 Further Topics**
- **Branching Processes.**  
- **Absorption Probabilities.**

## **5. SEMI-MARKOV, MARKOV RENEWAL, AND REGENERATIVE PROCESSES**  
### **5.1 Introduction and Preliminaries**
- **Extension of Markov Chains allowing time-varying transitions.**  

### **5.2 Classification of States**
- **Transient, recurrent, and absorbing states are extended to Semi-Markov settings.**  

### **5.3-5.9 Key Concepts**
- **Regenerative Processes:** Processes that restart at random points.  
- **Queueing Application:** Used in call centers, inventory models.  
- **Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC):** Models where transitions occur in continuous time.  
- **Birth and Death Processes:** Models population dynamics or queues.  

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Poisson Process:** Models random arrivals with exponential interarrival times.  
2. **Renewal Theory:** Deals with repeated independent events and their long-run behavior.  
3. **Markov Chains:** Memoryless stochastic processes with applications in finance, queueing, and genetics.  
4. **Semi-Markov Processes:** More flexible than Markov Chains, used in queueing theory.  
5. **Applications:** Optimization, AI models, supply chain management, and statistical decision-making.
